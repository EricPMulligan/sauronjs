# SauronJS
SauronJS is a library that was created to help developers build interactive components while leveraging server-side technologies. The goal was to allow for standard server-side development to be used primarily, and add interactivity where required.

Coupled with a library like [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) or [Turbograft](https://github.com/Shopify/turbograft/), it can make a standard web app feel like a Single Page Application (SPA).

Its name comes from the use of the observer pattern followed in [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/), the main dependency for the library. It allows developers to write better structured and more maintainable JavaScript.

## Principles
- Treat the DOM as a model
- Minimize AJAX requests to backend
- Use SauronJS to build descriptive data flows and handle submission intelligently

## Potential Upcoming Improvements
- Demo application & Documentation
- Renaming data-fs -> data-sj
- Clearly defined method of passing data from the server to SauronJS
- Ruby Gem for easy installation
- Plugins for Turbolinks & Turbograft
- ECMAScript 6 w/ Babel for ESNext
- More base elements/components/events
- Set folder structure and import/exports
- Better instantiation of SauronJS
- More Lifecycle hooks
